  bos_instruct: |
    Definition: The output will be 'positive' if the aspect identified in the sentence contains a positive sentiment. If the sentiment of the identified aspect in the input is negative the answer will be 'negative'. 
    Otherwise, the output should be 'neutral'. For aspects which are classified as noaspectterm, the sentiment is none.
